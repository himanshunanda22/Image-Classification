## Introduction

Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision that has a wide range of applications, including object recognition, medical image analysis, and more. This repository aims to provide a collection of image classification methods implemented using popular libraries and frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. The project also serves as a learning resource for those interested in understanding and implementing image classification algorithms.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these installation steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/himanshunanda22/image-classification.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd image-classification`
3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended): `virtualenv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
5. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset (see the [Dataset](#dataset) section for more details).
2. Choose a model from the [Models](#models) section or implement your own.
3. Train the selected model using the provided code.
4. Evaluate the trained model using the evaluation techniques outlined in the [Evaluation](#evaluation) section.
5. Experiment with hyperparameters, data augmentation, and other techniques to improve performance.

## Dataset

The success of image classification heavily depends on the quality and diversity of the dataset used for training and evaluation. In this project, we recommend using well-known datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST, or custom datasets relevant to your application. Make sure to preprocess the data appropriately and split it into training, validation, and testing subsets.

## Models

This project includes the following image classification models:

1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
2. Residual Neural Network (ResNet)
3. Transfer Learning (using pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet50, etc.)

Feel free to explore each model's implementation in the respective directories. You can choose a model based on the complexity of your task and the available computing resources.

## Evaluation

Evaluating the performance of your image classification model is crucial. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. You can use these metrics to understand how well your model is performing and make necessary adjustments to improve its performance.

## Contributing

Contributions to this image classification project are welcome! If you've implemented a new model, improved an existing one, or have any other valuable additions, feel free to create a pull request. Please ensure your code follows good coding practices and includes appropriate documentation.
